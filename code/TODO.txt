TODO:

(1) Initialization [DONE]

Mixed Chart (Initialization)  [DONE]
- Add chart that get var to bin from dropdown --> check bins_settings for the column --> bin it --> count and generate chart

Summary Statistic Table (Before) (Initialization)  [DONE]
- Empty df

Summary Statistic Table (After) (Initialization)  [DONE]
- Use StatCalculator.compute_summary_stat_table to get a stat df and show it with DataTable()

Interactive Binning Control Panel (Initialization)  [DONE]
- Check whether the col is categorical or numerical --> show the corresponding create new bin UI

Automated Binning Panel (Initialization)  [DONE]
- Check whether the col is categorical or numerical --> Show no binning UI (categorical has no equal-width/equal-freq dropdown choice)

(2) User trigger event

Automated Binning Panel  [DONE]
- When the user clicked on the 'Refresh' button, gather all required info, use BinningMachine.perform_binning_on_col to bin the column and store in shared storage as temp_binned_col_df
  At the same time, simply count and generate mixed chart, as well as compute summary statistical table, use the (after) one replace the (before) one, and replace the (after) one with
  newly computed table

Predictor Var Dropdown (Any changes in column to bin) 
- Trigger re-generate of mixed chart (same steps as initialization)
- Trigger summary statistic table (before) to use empty df (same steps as initialization)
- Trigger summary statistic table (after) to use StatCalculator.compute_summary_stat_table to get a stat df and show it with DataTable() (same steps as initialization)
- Trigger reload of interactive binning control panel (same steps as initialization)

Mixed Chart
- When user selected on 1 or more bar(s), it/they changes color
- When user selected bar(s) selection changes, check if it is categorical or numerical, and check if the user selected no bins, or single bin or 2 or more bins, show the
  corresponding control panel UI

Interactive Binning Control Panel
