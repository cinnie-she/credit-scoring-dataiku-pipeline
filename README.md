# 2022-23 RMBI Capstone Project (credit-scoring-dataiku-pipeline)
Group 2 - Cinnie, Emily, Sammi (Leader)

## Project Description: 
Sprint Milestone provides risk management solutions for Fintech and Financial Service clients. We would like 
to explore how to conduct interactive binning and reject inference for credit scoring.  

## Research Questions: 
1. How can we automate initial binning of variables and based on visualizations change the binning 
interactively during the model development process? 
2. How can we automate the reject inference process based on a defined objective function with 
constraints to assign a binary performance on unknown groups? 

## Project Aims and Objectives: 
The project’s first objective is to provide an initial bin of variables. Then to visualize these bins so that they 
can be interactively re‐binned during the model development process. And finally, to identify a reject 
inference approach to assign financial performance of a truncated population. 

## Project Expected Deliverables: 
1. Automated binning of variables 
2. Interactive binning of variables via a visualization interface 
3. Develop a reject inference engine to assign performance to truncated populations (if enough time) 

## Expected Outcome: 
1. Dashboard to monitor automated and interactive binning of variables 
2. Linkage of binned variables within model development process 
3. Reject Inference solution (if enough time)
